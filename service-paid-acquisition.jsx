                  <h3>Why <em>generic ad agencies fail</em> in this space</h3>
                  <p>Most marketing agencies run the same playbook across every vertical: a lead-gen campaign, a landing page, a thank-you page. For medspas, this produces discount-hunters, no-shows, and leads who are shocked by your pricing. The aesthetic medicine patient has a specific psychology — treatments are identity-adjacent, emotionally driven, and require a trust-building sequence that generic creative cannot create.</p>
                  <p>We've run campaigns across injectables, laser, CoolSculpting, weight-loss/GLP-1, microneedling, IV therapy, and skin tightening. We know which creative hooks burn out fastest (dramatic before/afters typically saturate in 6–8 weeks). We know the compliance guardrails. We know which offer types produce high-LTV patients vs. one-time discount chasers. That experience is baked into every campaign we build.</p>
