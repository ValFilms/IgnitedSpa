                  <h3>The offer is <em>everything</em></h3>
                  <p>Most medspas make the same mistake: they run ads to their homepage or a generic "book now" page. There's no specific offer, no qualification step, no reason for a cold prospect to take action today. The result is low conversion rates, wasted ad spend, and the mistaken conclusion that "ads don't work for us."</p>
                  <p>Ads work when the offer is right. A signature offer — a specific treatment, at a specific price point, with a specific value proposition — does three things simultaneously: it attracts the right patients, pre-qualifies their intent, and gives the algorithm a clear conversion to optimize toward. We've built dozens of these offers across every medspa treatment category. We know what converts.</p>
